The RTC folder contains a python script (RTC_v#.py) to perform radiometric terrain correction (RTC)
on Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data via the European Space Agency's (ESA) SentiNels-1 Application
Platform (i.e. SNAP). The script reads in an input file with the location of an external DEM, if specified
(default = SRTM), the location of the GRD zip file, the location of an output directory to be created, and 
the desired output pixel size. 

Setup: 
1) Create a dedicated Anaconda environment for RTC processing (e.g. conda create -n RTC_process) and activate it. 
2) Install necessary dependencies; these include both Python and non-Python dependencies (see below).
3) Update the RTC_v3.py code for the local pathways of SNAP and gdal (see below; this will be updated in future versions).

Execution:
1) Customize the input file (e.g. rtc_sample_inputs.txt) for the desired inputs. 
2) Call the script: python RTC_v#.py rtc_sample_inputs.txt) 

Dependencies (Python):
- geopandas
- shapefly

Dependencies (non-Python):
- gdal (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library; https://gdal.org/)
- SNAP: install SNAP (https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/)
Note: A SNAP update may be necessary, even after a fresh install. 
    E.g. /local_path_to_snap/snap/bin/snap --nosplash --nogui --modules --update-all
