The ASF_API contains 2 sample python scripts to pull Sentinel-1 data from the Alaska SAR Facility (ASF)
archive. The script creates a user defined directory, retrieves Earth Data login credentials from the user's 
bachrc file, downloads the data the user defined directory, and creates a log file using the standard output. 

Setup: 
1) Create a dedicated Anaconda environment (e.g. conda create -n asf_api python=3.7.x). As of today 10/20/2022, 
   python versions 3.7 and 3.8 are compatible; v3.10 was not. 
   
2) Install ASF's python wrapper for its API, asf_search (conda install -c conda-forge asf_search)

   for a full list of keywords. 
   
2) activate conda environment with asf_search library (e.g. conda activate asf_api)

3) Call the script: python sentinel_adf_searchAPI_XXXXXX.py
